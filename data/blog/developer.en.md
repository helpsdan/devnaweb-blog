## Hey guys, how are you doing? <a name="introduction"></a>

This is the article `What is a developer? How to become a developer?` with which I want to bring a vision of what professions are available for you to practice and languages ​​and technologies that you can learn.

A developer is a person responsible for creating or working on the development of a product or service. Most developers use one or more programming languages ​​to develop their product or service. It is also common for developers to work alone or in one or more teams during the development of an application.

Companies like Apple, Amazon and Google employ a variety of developers, due to the complexity of the products and services they develop and sell to their customers. For example, a software developer is an individual who can create a new software program or maintain an existing software program. A web developer is an individual who creates or updates web pages using HTML, Javascript or other web programming languages. Let's see a little further on the professions that developers exercise in companies.

## How to become a developer? <a name="become-dev"></a>

If you've come this far, you're probably interested in pursuing a career in development and don't know where to start, so here's a guide to salaries, technical skills, and the best languages ​​to learn.

The development field is among the most sought-after tech professionals, with increasing demand and talent shortages leading to high salaries for many professionals in the field. It is worth mentioning that it is a profession that is growing worldwide, if you do a simple Google search, you will see that many Brazilians today work abroad receiving in foreign currency. `(I'll do a post on that shortly)` That said, software development is a dynamic area, where new programming languages, frameworks and technologies can live and die in a few years, and work needs are constantly changing.

In order to help those interested in the area better understand how to start a career in development, I have compiled some details and resources that may be important for you on your journey.

### Why is the demand for developers growing? <a name="dev-demand"></a>

Every company has become a technology company to some degree, with digital transformation projects underway in most industries to prevent disruption. This means that demand for developers has skyrocketed in recent years as companies look for people who can bring digital projects and applications to life.
Among the 10 most wanted jobs for 2021 are programmer analyst, mobile app developer, software developer and DevOps engineer.

The changes that the COVID-19 pandemic brought us accelerated the increase in demand for developers in a few years, so many companies end up looking for professionals outside the country to be able to fill open positions. The rise of e-commerce as companies shifted from in-person shopping to online shopping has also caused the demand for web developers to increase greatly around the planet.

### Which college to choose to become a developer? <a name="dev-university"></a>

To become a good developer, it is necessary for you to have some theoretical and technical knowledge about the area in general, which you obtain through training, whether it is a course or college. I want to make it clear that it is not necessary for you to go to college or take a course to become a developer, it all depends on how self-taught you are. I know people who are senior professionals and have never set foot in a college, but anyway I leave here some courses or colleges that can make a good difference.

In addition to courses at colleges, there are free courses lasting less than a few months, which may address specific topics or others that may address more than one technology. However, if you are interested in taking a higher education course, this would certainly be a differential on your resume and could increase your competitiveness in the area with other professionals.

There are many courses in the area of ​​technology available for you who want to be a developer, see below the main higher courses focused on programming:

computer engineering

Analysis and systems development

Computer science

### What are the average developers salaries? <a name="dev-salary"></a>

The job market for developers is very hot and expanding, with a vast amount of new vacancies and good salaries, `I believe this is one of the points that many people are migrating to this area`.

A survey on the Glassdoor website that helps people identify salary values, interviews, reviews about companies shows us that a backend developer earns an average of R$ 5,071 per month. Of course, this average depends on some factors, such as the place you are looking for the job, the professional level and the company itself. Here are some examples:

`REMEMBER: THESE ARE VALUES AT BRAZIL LEVEL, REGARDLESS OF THE DEVELOPER LEVEL. JUST TO EXAMPLE.`
