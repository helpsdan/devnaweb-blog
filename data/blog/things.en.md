### Hey devs, look me here again! How are you?

I hope they say these things are probably that I may have gone through a little bit with myself, each of which may be earlier, each time you may be going through, each time you may have gone through, finally having a trajectory. This is the post `10 things I wish I knew when programming it`, I hope you like it.

### Send CV even if not ready <a name="1"></a>

Perhaps this was one of my biggest difficulties in the beginning, the insecurity of sending a resume when you had no experience or were just studying. I waited too long to send my resume believing I wasn't ready, but here's a tip, let the companies decide if you are or not. When you send your resume and participate in interviews, you can see how much your skill and your market need, this also makes you see what you need to study and practice for a given opportunity.

### Your personal skills are just as important as your technical skills <a name="2"></a>

It doesn't matter if you're the best developer if you don't know how to introduce yourself. Learn to communicate better, learn to write a cool resume and sell yourself. Knowing how to interview is also a skill, you need to train and prepare.

### Don't copy and paste code <a name="3"></a>

When you type the code yourself instead of copying and pasting, at first you end up doing a big difference. It makes you feel more comfortable with the code even if you don't understand it 100%.

### Work on personal projects <a name="4"></a>

Today we have many companies that hire inexperienced developers, but in many others you need some experience to get the job. This doesn't necessarily have to be a job, you can create apps or websites to develop and showcase your skills as a portfolio. This blog serves a lot like that, it requires certain knowledge with which some I needed to learn to be able to put it on the air. So show your skills.

### Learn to ask better questions <a name="5"></a>

It's very important that you know how to ask the right questions to get the right answers, if you can't find something you're looking for it's because you're not asking the right question. Learn to ask better questions.

### Be patient while learning <a name="6"></a>

Canadian journalist and writer `Malcolm Gladwell` wrote the successful book Outliers in the year 2008. His prevailing hypothesis was condensed in one expression: the 10,000 hour rule. In short, it's not natural talent that matters, but practice that makes perfect. So relax and pay attention to the code, you will get there.

### Do not choose a job opportunity based on the amount paid <a name="7"></a>

Many companies will present you with a truckload of money, it has happened to me a few times after a few years of experience, but don't choose your first job based on salary, choose an apprenticeship opportunity, money is always a consequence of good work. Sometimes an unpaid internship is worth more than many others with a good salary.

### Keep an open mind <a name="8"></a>

Be open-minded to learn `any` technology at any time. New technologies emerge every day and companies end up using these new technologies, which makes rapid and effective learning necessary. So keep in mind that continuous learning is what sets you apart from other developers.

### Network <a name="9"></a>

It is extremely important for you to meet people who work in the area, whether in online or face-to-face events, this contact, no matter how simple in the future, can become an opportunity for you.

### Use your linkedin to your advantage <a name="10"></a>

Linkedin has become a very relevant tool for recruiters around the world to find developers like you, so try to create an attractive and optimized linkedin so that you can be found and get more results.

### Bonus <a name="bonus"></a>

Always keep up to date, try to read the tech news whenever you can. This sets you apart from many developers on the market, study whenever you can and keep in mind that this is a profession that changes so fast that there is always something new to learn.

### Conclusion <a name="finish"></a>

These were some of the tips I wish I had received when I started programming. If you made it this far, print the screen there and post it on insta and I'll repost all of you!

Hugs my dear dev.
