## Hey devs, how everything is going? <a name="introduction"></a>

This is the post `hello world` of devnaweb so we can start! :)

#### How everything started? <a name="start"></a>

I've been a software developer for a few years, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, and I've always wanted to share my knowledge in some way. In 2019 I had the idea of ​​creating a blog, but as you can see, this idea only really came to reality in 2022. During 2020 I created a blog using wordpress (`which I do not recommend you to create`) but I didn't posted or shared any article. So now it really started! I have a lot of content planned to post, and the idea is that for some time it will be a daily content posted here on the page.

#### What is the aim of this blog? <a name="aim"></a>

The aim of this blog is to share knowledge, and try to bring another way to understand the concepts and technologies.

#### What is the purpose? <a name="purpose"></a>

I believe that my purpose and the purpose of this blog are very similar, in addition to sharing knowledge I would like to give back to the IT area trying to help people get their first job because it is a very complicated area to get your first one. job, but I believe that together we can fix it.

#### Conclusion <a name="finish"></a>

Finally, I would like to thank the readers and the curious who arrive here, let's start the journey that all of this is just the beginning.

Thank you so much, devs!
